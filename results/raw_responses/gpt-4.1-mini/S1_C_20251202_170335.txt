User description: Vegetarian-friendly, mid-price, dislikes dog-friendly and bar-type places.

User preferences: {'categories_any_of': ['Vegetarian', 'Vegan', 'Healthy'], 'price_in': ['$', '$$'], 'min_rating': 4.0}
User aversions: {'dog_friendly': True, 'categories_any_of': ['Sports Bar', 'Pub', 'Bar'], 'tags_any_of': ['bar', 'sports']}

First, think step-by-step in bullet points:
1. Restate preferences and aversions.
2. Filter restaurants based on aversions (explaining which ones you remove and why).
3. From the remaining restaurants, select the top 5 that best satisfy preferences.

Then, at the VERY END, output ONLY valid JSON on a SINGLE LINE:
{"recommendations": ["Name1", "Name2", "Name3", "Name4", "Name5"]}
