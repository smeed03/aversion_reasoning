User description: Needs a quiet, wheelchair-accessible place to talk, dislikes loud or cramped spots and does not care about alcohol.

User preferences: {'noise_level_any_of': ['quiet'], 'wheelchair_accessible': True, 'min_rating': 4.0}
User aversions: {'noise_level_any_of': ['loud'], 'tags_any_of': ['lively', 'sports']}

First, think step-by-step in bullet points:
1. Restate preferences and aversions.
2. Filter restaurants based on aversions (explaining which ones you remove and why).
3. From the remaining restaurants, select the top 5 that best satisfy preferences.

Then, at the VERY END, output ONLY valid JSON on a SINGLE LINE:
{"recommendations": ["Name1", "Name2", "Name3", "Name4", "Name5"]}


=== MODEL OUTPUT ===
- Preferences: The user wants a quiet restaurant (noise level: quiet), that is wheelchair accessible, with a minimum rating of 4.0. They do not care about alcohol availability.
- Aversions: The user dislikes loud or cramped places, and dislikes places tagged as lively or sports.

Step 2: Filter restaurants based on aversions:
- Remove Dockside Pub & Grill (noise level loud, tags: lively, sports)
- Remove Fells Point Cantina (noise level loud, tags: lively)
- Remove Harborview Sports Bar (noise loud, tags: lively, sports)
- Remove Baltimore Brew & Bites (tags: lively)
- Remove Harbor Flame Grill (noise moderate but tagged kid-friendly, family - family is not an aversion but it may be noisier, but noise level is moderate, so keep it for now)
- All others are either quiet or moderate, but moderate noise is not preferred, only quiet is, so we remove moderate noise places:
  - Harbor Flame Grill (moderate)
  - Charm City Thai (moderate)
  - Bayfront Bistro (moderate)
  - The Spicy Spoon (moderate)
  - Family Table Diner (moderate)
  - Riverside Bistro (moderate)
  - Spice Route Grill (moderate)
  - Urban Greens Café (moderate)
  - Neighborhood Noodles (moderate)
  - Baltimore Brew & Bites (already removed for lively)
- Keep only quiet noise level places that are wheelchair accessible and rating >= 4.0:
  - Golden Lotus (noise quiet, wheelchair accessible, rating 4.6)
  - Little India Palace (quiet, wheelchair accessible, rating 4.5)
  - Mandarin Harbor (quiet, wheelchair accessible, rating 4.6)
  - La Terraza Tapas (quiet, wheelchair accessible, rating 4.7)
  - Green Leaf Deli (quiet, wheelchair accessible, rating 4.6)
  - Quiet Corner Café (quiet, wheelchair accessible, rating 4.4)

Step 3: Select top 5 from above based on rating:
- La Terraza Tapas, rating 4.7
- Golden Lotus, rating 4.6
- Mandarin Harbor, rating 4.6
- Green Leaf Deli, rating 4.6
- Little India Palace, rating 4.5

Quiet Corner Café rating 4.4 is good but not top 5.
