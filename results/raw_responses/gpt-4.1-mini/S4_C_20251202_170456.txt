User description: Wants a place to watch the game with a sports-bar vibe but really dislikes very loud and rowdy environments.

User preferences: {'categories_any_of': ['Sports Bar', 'Pub'], 'tags_any_of': ['sports', 'bar', 'lively'], 'min_rating': 4.0}
User aversions: {'noise_level_any_of': ['loud'], 'tags_any_of': ['rowdy']}

First, think step-by-step in bullet points:
1. Restate preferences and aversions.
2. Filter restaurants based on aversions (explaining which ones you remove and why).
3. From the remaining restaurants, select the top 5 that best satisfy preferences.

Then, at the VERY END, output ONLY valid JSON on a SINGLE LINE:
{"recommendations": ["Name1", "Name2", "Name3", "Name4", "Name5"]}


=== MODEL OUTPUT ===
- Preferences: The user wants a place with a sports-bar vibe, specifically categories including Sports Bar or Pub, with tags like sports, bar, lively, and a minimum rating of 4.0.
- Aversions: The user dislikes very loud and rowdy environments, so restaurants with noise level "loud" or tags including "rowdy" should be filtered out.

Step 2: Filter based on aversions:
- Dockside Pub & Grill: noise level is loud → remove.
- Fells Point Cantina: noise level is loud → remove.
- Harborview Sports Bar: noise level is loud → remove.
There are no mentions of "rowdy" tags explicitly in any restaurant, so no further filtering for that.

Step 3: From remaining, select those in categories Sports Bar or Pub, with tags sports, bar, lively, minimum rating 4.0:
- Dockside Pub & Grill was removed.
- Harborview Sports Bar was removed.
- Harbor Flame Grill: categories American, Barbecue—not Sports Bar or Pub → exclude.
- No other restaurant is specifically Sports Bar or Pub with sports, bar, lively tags except:
After filtering, we have no Sports Bar or Pub options left that meet the noise level criteria.

Therefore, the only matching restaurant is Harbor Flame Grill, which has tags family, kid-friendly, and moderate noise, but not specifically sports bar or pub.

Given no perfect matches, check if any pubs or sports bars have moderate noise and the rest preferences:
- There is no Pub or Sports Bar with moderate noise except Dockside Pub (loud), Harborview Sports Bar (loud).
Hence, no strictly fitting options.

The conclusion is that no restaurants strictly match all preferences and aversions.

Since the user wants a sports bar vibe but dislikes loud environments, recommend none or possibly Harbor Flame Grill as a compromise (it is moderately noisy, family-friendly, serves alcohol, dog-friendly, outdoor seating).

But as per instruction, only include those that satisfy the filters.

Hence:
