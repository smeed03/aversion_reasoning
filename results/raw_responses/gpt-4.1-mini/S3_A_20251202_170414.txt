=== MODEL OUTPUT ===
1. Charm City Thai – Offers authentic and spicy Thai cuisine with a high rating of 4.8 and matches the spicy-focused preference without being touristy or formal.  
2. Spice Route Grill – Serves authentic and spicy Indian and Middle Eastern dishes with outdoor seating, a solid rating, and a casual atmosphere.  
3. Little India Palace – Provides authentic, spicy-focused Indian vegetarian options in a quiet and accessible setting with a good rating of 4.5.  
4. The Spicy Spoon – Features authentic and spicy Indian and Szechuan cuisine, meeting the spicy focus requirement with a 4.1 rating in a casual environment.  
5. Harbor Flame Grill – (Not spicy or matching category) No, discard this. Instead: No others match the exact spicy-focused and category criteria better than the above four. Only 4 fully match all criteria.

Since only four restaurants fully meet the criteria (spicy focus, Thai/Indian/Szechuan, rating >=4.0, authentic, not touristy/formal), I provide those four as solid recommendations.
